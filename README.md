Ecommerce Sales Analysis
📊 Using the Sample Super Store dataset, I embarked on an incredible data visualization adventure, discovering the power of Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights.
🎯 Here are the key highlights of my Power BI dashboard:
1️⃣ Data Exploration: I began by understanding Power BI as a tool and its versatile applications, familiarizing myself with its user-friendly interface.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing: A real-world dataset is never perfect. I learned to filter, clean, and standardize the data using Power Editor, removing nulls, duplicates, and irrelevant information.
3️⃣ Visualization Mastery:  creating stunning charts, graphs, and scorecards possible. I learned how to present complex data in an engaging and insightful manner.
4️⃣ Filtering and Slicing: I utilized effective filters and slicers to tailor the dashboard to specific needs. This allowed me to focus on specific regions, time periods, and other relevant factors, enhancing the user experience.
5️⃣ Data Comparison: Leveraging the power of Power Query, I connected multiple datasets, performed merge and append operations, and used group by/split columns to gain meaningful insights.
6️⃣ Predictive Analytics: The true power of my dashboard lies in its ability to establish relationships in Power BI and uncover hidden trends and correlations, empowering data-driven decision-making.
7️⃣ DAX Mastery: I honed my Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) skills to perform complex calculations and analyses, resulting in dynamic and informative reports.
